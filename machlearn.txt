GLOSSARY
--------
Patch : a specific configuration of parameters that encodes a particular synthesizer sound.
.syx : file extension used for a bank of synthesizer patches.

BACKGROUND
----------
Modern digital music synthesizers maintain "patch" memory: on-board storage dedicated to 
remembering parameters used for generating particular types of sounds. Patch memory can
be exported (and imported) to (from) external memory, by writing it to (or reading it from) 
.syx files.

              ^
              |
              |------------------------> .syx file


OBJECTIVE
---------
Given a large, random collection of .syx files targetting a specific synthesizer (eg. Yamaha DX7), 
is it possible to apply machine learning to the parameters that encode the patches in order to
create a model that clusters patches into groups of related sound types? Eg. this is the "brass" 
cluster, this is the "strings" cluster, etc. etc. 
The idea is that when a new patch is encountered, we have an informed idea of what it is likely
to sound like, based on which cluster our model places it.

Stage 1:

LOTS of .syx files -----> MACHINE LEARNING ------> cluster-based patch model

Stage 2:

Random patch -----> model -----> this patch belongs to cluster X


YAMAHA DX7
----------
I would like to try this with Yamaha DX7 patches given that I own a Yamaha DX7 and have access
to around ~10k Yamaha DX7 .syx files.

Each Yamaha DX7 .syx file describes a bank of 32 patches.

I have public code for dumping Yamaha DX7 .syx files here:

https://github.com/weekend-at-bernies/sysex_utils

I have annotated an example of dumping a Yamaha DX7 .syx file using my code below. I have only
shown the output for the first patch (there are 32 all up in a single .syx file for Yamaha DX7).

The challenge I believe is to work out which of the parameters to best "cluster" on in order to
properly group similar sounding patches.

Obviously it makes no sense to use the patch name or number - so these parameter values can instantly
be dismissed. That leaves the rest of the parameter data: stuff such as 'Algorithm', 'LFO', 'Feedback'
and the 6 operators.
